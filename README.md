# Overview
UHBadger is a money management and planning application that will allow for user and admin accounts. It will track and analyze users' spending to help them optimize their spending.

## Technical Notes 
   ### Installation

First, [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/developers/install).

Second, download [UHBadger](https://github.com/UHBadger/UHBadger) and request permission to gain access to UHBadger. 

Third, cd into the app/ directory and install required libraries: meteor:

```
$ meteor npm install
```

 ### Running the Application

After installation, you can run the application by typing:

```
$ meteor npm run start
```
The first time running the application will add default users: 

```
$ meteor npm run start

> meteor-application-template-react-production@1.0.3 start /Users/choi/Desktop/GitHub/UHBadger/app
> meteor --no-release-check --exclude-archs web.browser.legacy,web.cordova --settings ../config/settings.development.json

[[[[[ ~/Desktop/GitHub/UHBadger/app ]]]]]     

=> Started proxy.                             
=> Started MongoDB.                           
I20220626-15:22:26.896(-10)? Monti APM: completed instrumenting the app
=> Started your app.

=> App running at: http://localhost:3000/
```

### Viewing the running app locally
If everything goes well, the template application appears at http://localhost:3000. 

### ES Lint
We can run ESLint to verify that our code complies with coding standards.
```
meteor npm run lint
```


## Closing Thoughts
From this project, we learned that overall software development should focus more on the security aspects of the application, although the function and appearance of the page are important as well. While making this project, our team tried and tested many things and found that improvement was needed. 
   ### Challenges
   * This is an online class, so we communicated with each other on Discord. 
   * Usually we have 4 months to work on a project, but this time we only had 4 weeks to complete it. 
   ### Surprises
   * We completed all tasks and finished the project on schedule.
   * Each member of our group is good at communicating and teaching each other.
